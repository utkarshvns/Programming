Economic Overview and Outlook
The global economic expansion decelerated in the second
half of 2018 largely because of increased trade tensions
and tariff hikes between the United States and China. After
peaking at close to 4% in 2017, global growth dropped
to 3.6% in FY 2018. As per the World Economic Outlook
report of International Monetary Fund, released in April
2019, global economy is projected to decline further to
3.3% in 2019.
The growth in Emerging Market and Developing Economies
is also expected to slow down to 4.4% in 2019 from
4.5% in 2018. Nevertheless, the Indian economy grew 7.1%
in 2018 and is expected to accelerate 7.3% in 2019, retaining
its position as the fastest growing economy in the world.
Pharmaceutical Sector Overview
Global
The pharmaceutical industry plays a unique role in
improving the lives of patients. It is also one of the
world’s fastest growing industries and among the biggest
contributors to the world economy.
Global spending
According to the IQVIA Institute paper published in January
2019, global spending on medicines reached USD 1.2
trillion in 2018 and is set to exceed USD 1.5 trillion by 2023.
This would be a 3–6% annual growth rate over the next five
years – a notable slowdown from the 6.3% seen over the
past five years. The key drivers of growth will continue to be
the United States and pharmerging markets with 4–7% and
5–8% compound annual growth, respectively.
Pharmerging market growth continues to derive primarily
from increasing per capita use, but some markets are
seeing wider uptake of newer medicines as patients’ ability
to afford their share-of-costs improves with economic
growth. Growth in developed countries will come with
higher proportion of aged population.

GLOBAL SPENDING ON MEDICINES

Spending by geography
USA is expected to continue to be the world’s largest
pharmaceutical market and its share in global spending is
projected to increase to USD 625-655 billion in FY 2023 from
USD 485 billion in FY 2018. The European share of spending
will grow to USD 195-225 billion from USD 178 billion, in this
period. Meanwhile, pharmerging countries will spend USD
355 billion in FY 2023 against USD 286 billion in FY 2018.

Regions, 2018-2023
GLOBAL PREDICTIONS
India
As per IQVIA, in FY 2019, the Indian Pharmaceutical Market
(IPM) stood at about USD 19.5 billion, growing at 10.5%,
growth being contributed almost equally by volume, price
and new launches. The IPM hitherto considered immune to
economic downturns, seems to be defying the trend and
has slowed down in tandem with the broader economy.
Analysis of IPM’s growth drivers indicates slowdown from
13.5% to 10% over the past three years. There are various
external forces impacting the IPM at present. Growth

from product introduction has also nearly halved as the
regulator is more careful with new combination drugs.
Frequent regulatory interventions have added to the woes.
Regulations on price control, and proposed ban on FDCs,
INN prescriptions as well as “One Company – One Brand”
regulations, indicates increasing regulatory scrutiny in
India, which in turn is expected to shape the growth of the
industry.
Rest of Asia
As per a recent study by IQVIA, most Asian markets still have
room to grow. Based on the analysis, it classifies the region
into three groups: mature (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan);
maturing (Thailand, Malaysia, China); and emerging
(Philippines, India, Vietnam, Pakistan, and Indonesia). The
emerging markets are clearly ripe for sustainable growth
stories. For instance, as per industry estimates, Philippines
is the third-largest pharmaceutical market in ASEAN,
predicted to exceed USD 4 billion by 2020 – recording a
compound annual growth rate of over 3.5% in five years. The
Philippines’ disease burden is shifting from communicable
to non-communicable diseases. Cardiovascular disease is
the leading cause of death, and one in three deaths are
caused by heart disease.
Africa
The pharmaceuticals market in Africa is expected to reach
a business opportunity of USD 45 billion in 2020 (Frost
& Sullivan, Dec 2016), propelled by a convergence of
changing economic profiles, rapid urbanisation, increased
healthcare spending and investment, and increasing
incidence of chronic lifestyle diseases. The tropical climate
of Africa makes the continent the largest reservoir of
infectious diseases, particularly malaria, tuberculosis (TB)
and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), besides
frequent outbreaks of polio, meningitis, cholera, pandemic
influenza, yellow fever, measles, hepatitis, and tetanus. With
the increasing adoption of Western lifestyle in Africa, there
has been a paradigm shift in the burden of illness towards
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), driving the demand
for chronic prescription drugs. The growing middle-class is
a key driving force for pharmaceuticals spending. Limited
affordability of governments and the general population
for healthcare and pharmaceuticals and a high reliance on
donor funding will be the major market restraints.
USA
United States alone holds over 40% of the USD 1.2 trillion
global pharmaceutical market with spending of USD 485
billion in 2018. Generics continue to enjoy a formidable
percentage of USA’s pharmaceutical market with accounting
for more than 90% of total prescriptions dispensed. Within
the past 5 years, drugs worth USD 83 billion have gone offpatent and another USD 72 billion worth of small molecule
drugs slated to go off-patent in the next 5 years, as per IQVIA
Institute report in February 2019. Declining prices in the
generics market due to rising competition from the surge
in ANDA approvals and consolidation of distributors, has
taken a toll on the generics market value. Though the US
generic market will be challenging over the medium term,
given the pricing and competition risks, Indian companies
with clear visibility in terms of US pipeline, in advanced
stage of making investments in complex molecule, robust
supply chain setups in the US and strong internal quality
processes in compliance with FDA guidelines, are bound
to succeed.
Company Overview
Ajanta Pharma is a specialty pharmaceutical formulation
company engaged in the development, manufacture and
marketing of quality finished dosages. The Company has a
well-diversified and de-risked business model with branded
generics in India, Asia and Africa, generics in USA and
Institutional business in Africa, comprising a wide range of
products, in more than 30 countries.
The competitive edge Ajanta Pharma has built over the
years, in terms of customised products for every market
where it operates, continues to provide it the impetus for
growth. In spite of sharp decline in its institutional business,
it has been able to recoup part of this loss in other markets,
thereby posting a much lower de-growth in total revenue
for FY 2019.
Operational Highlights for FY 2019
•	 Consolidated Turnover at ` 2,055 cr.
•	 Consolidated Profit after Tax at ` 387 cr.
•	 R&D spend at 9% of revenue
Performance Highlights
India
Ajanta Pharma’s India business continued to perform well
steered by strong focus on high growth speciality segments.
Total sales from India business stood at ` 690 cr. against
` 629 cr. in the previous year

As per IMS MAT March 2019, the Company outgrew Indian
Pharmaceutical Market (IPM) recording 16% growth
compared to 11% for the industry. Within the specialty
segments that the Company operates in, all segments
recorded higher than industry growth. Company has also
improved its ranking in IPM to 31 against 32 last year.

The Company continues to strengthen product portfolio
through new launches, many of them being first-to-market
products, offering significant patient benefits. Apart from
new launches, many of the Company’s existing products
continue to grow their market share.
Exports
Total sales from international business for FY 2019 stood
at ` 1,324 cr. against ` 1,434 cr. in the previous year, a
decline of 8%. This decline was primarily due to shrinking of
institutional business in Africa, which saw a decline of 49%
for the year. In Asia and Africa, branded generics business
continued to remain robust in individual markets, though
it was soft for company due to streamlining of inventory
levels in these countries. The performance in US had been
excellent for the year with growth of 46% for FY 2019,
led by new product launches and gain in market share in
existing products.

Operational and Financial Performance
It was a year of challenges, with revenue and profitability
both getting impacted by an expected tapering of lumpy
institutional business and bringing efficiency through
streamlining of inventory levels. The focus was clearly on
looking beyond the short-term challenges being faced
and prepare the organisation for tomorrow’s growth
opportunities.
Profit and Loss Statement
Revenue from operations
Revenue from operations stood at ` 2,055 cr. in FY 2019
against ` 2,131 cr. in FY 2018, a decline of 4% over previous
year. The institutional business in Africa saw a major
decline, as expected, which was partially compensated by
growth in other markets.
Material costs
Material costs remained at 19% in FY 2019, almost at
the same level of previous year. It was indeed a great
achievement, given that the overall raw material prices had
inched up during the year.
Employee expenses
Personnel expenses inched up by about 300 basis points
from 18% last year to 21% in this year. Total cost stood
at ` 431 cr. for FY 2019 as against ` 376 cr. in FY 2018.
The increase was on account of full year impact of team
members added at different times during FY 2018, some
addition of teams at new plant locations of Dahej and
Guwahati, as also the annual increments provided for
the year.
Other expenses
Other expenses stood at ` 675 cr. in FY 2019 as against
` 690 cr. in FY 2018. We were able to further improve
efficiency in the operations with manufacturing, marketing,
distribution, R&D and administrative expenses being
monitored closely in the face of challenges. R&D cost
remained at 9% of total operating income in FY 2019,
though in absolute amount, it has seen slight reduction

to ` 176 cr. in FY 2019 from ` 185 cr. in FY 2018. Effective
steps are being taken to economise on all costs, without
impacting the business objectives.
Operating Profit Margin
EBITDA stood at ` 566 cr. in FY 2019, being 28% of operating
income as against ` 648 cr. in the previous year, being 31%
of operating income. As discussed earlier, higher employee
cost, plant overheads of 2 new manufacturing facilities and
lower revenue had impacted the margins.
Net Profit Margin
Net margins stood at 19% in FY 2019 against 22% in
FY 2018. In absolute value, the net profit was at ` 387 cr.
as against ` 469 cr., de-growth of 17% over previous year,
again for the reasons mentioned above.
Return on Net Worth
Return on Net Worth saw a sharp decline to 18% in FY 2019
against 26% for FY 2018. The impact is mainly on account
of continued investment in new manufacturing and R&D
facilities, which are at various stages of implementation.
The Company has undertaken major investments during
last 4 years to proactively meet the infrastructure needs for
future growth. It will improve returns once operations get
stabilised at these new facilities.
BALANCE SHEET
Non-current assets
We have added another ` 361 cr. in property plant and
equipment, in line with our plans to build world-class
infrastructure for meeting the future growth requirement.
The non-current assets have gone up to ` 1,515 cr. in
FY 2019 from ` 1,225 cr. in FY 2018.
Current assets
Current Assets came down to ` 1,181 cr. in FY 2019 from
` 1,224 cr. in FY 2018 mainly because of redemption of
investments, which were utilised for buy back of equity.
Current Ratio for FY 2019 stood at 3.1 against 3.5 in
FY 2018.
Trade Receivable remained almost at the same level of last
year in terms of absolute number at ` 459 cr., though in
terms of number of days to sales, it saw a marginal increase
to 83 days in FY 2019 from 81 days in FY 2018.
Inventories saw a sharp increase to ` 436 cr. in FY 2019 from
` 351 cr. in FY 2018 on the back of growing US operations,
which has a longer working capital cycle. In terms of number
of days to sales, it has gone up to 79 days in FY 2019 from
62 days in FY 2018.
Shareholders’ funds
Shareholders’ funds increased to ` 2,245 cr. in FY 2019
from ` 2,041 cr. in FY 2018. Earnings per share stood at
` 44 in FY 2019 as against ` 53 in FY 2018. During the year,
Company returned ` 100 cr. of shareholders’ fund to its
shareholders through share buyback and another ` 80 cr.
towards dividend.
Non-current liabilities
Increase in deferred tax has taken non-current liabilities to
` 73 cr. in FY 2019 from ` 61 cr. in FY 2018.
Current liabilities
A small working capital borrowing in US subsidiary for
better financial discipline resulted in higher current liability
at ` 378 cr. in FY 2019 against ` 346 cr. in FY 2018.
Human Assets
Ajanta Pharma has a diverse talent pool of over 6,900
Ajantaites, coming from 28 nationalities. The Company
acknowledges the pivotal role of Ajantaites in driving
continued success. Human Resource Development aims to
make Ajanta a preferred place to work. This is being achieved
through various initiatives including skill development,
personality enhancement, passionate leisure pursuits and
employee engagement through internal communications
to foster happiness at work.
Talent management at Ajanta means having most skilled
and engaged Ajantaites delivering their best in their
current roles while getting ready for higher responsibilities.
Ajantaites are among our indispensable assets for
continued success.
Risk Management
Ajanta Pharma has built a strong culture of managing risks
in a structured manner. Risk management committee
comprising Managing Director and Joint Managing Director
along with senior management, review key internal financial
controls and their effectiveness in the form of a risk
matrix, inherent risks associated with each function, risk
assessment and classification of these risks into different
categories. The work of risk management committee is
reviewed by audit committee and board periodically.
During the year, various key risks were identified, evaluated
and mitigated through a defined process. Some of the key
risks are:
Competition Risk
Competition is an integral part of all industries and
pharmaceutical is no exception. Different markets /

businesses have different intensities of competitions and
Company has a robust framework to identify its competitive
advantages like early-to-market, niche new product
launches through identifying unmet medical needs etc.
Regulatory Risk
Pharmaceutical is among one of the highly regulated
industries across the world. And rightly so as it deals with
evolving human life. These regulation impact development,
manufacturing, approval, marketing and distribution of
products, while throwing new compliance challenges.
A strong quality assurance mechanism and compliance
monitoring network at Ajanta ensures strict compliance
at every level. Regular training for its employees to
update them on new developments is an integral part of
this process.
Global Economic Volatility Risk
Ajanta has presence in more than 30 countries and each of
these markets present different economic and political risk.
A widespread global presence, with no overdependence
on any one region or country, considerably insulates
the Company from any uneventful developments in any
particular market.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The Company earns a major part of its revenue in foreign
exchange, thus exposing it to the volatility in the exchange
rates. This can have an adverse effect on its earnings. The
Company follows a conservative and disciplined hedging
policy which ensures protecting the desired exchange rate
for sustaining the profitability.
Internal Controls and Adequacy
Ajanta Pharma has institutionalised a robust and
comprehensive internal control mechanism across all the
major processes. It is integral to the principle of governance
and freedom is allowed to be exercised within a system of
checks and balances. All operations are governed through
automated internal business controls, centralised global
process framework and integrated key support functions.
Internal Controls safeguards company’s assets against loss
from unauthorised use and ensures reliability of financial
reporting. It is also designed for effectiveness and efficiency
of operations, compliance or regulations backed by strong
audit framework at all the locations. Audit Committee of the
Board reviews reports submitted by the independent internal
auditors and monitors follow-up and corrective actions.
Cautionary Statement
Statements in the Management Discussion and Analysis
describing the Company’s objective, projections, estimates,
expectations may be forward-looking statements. Actual
results may differ materially from those expressed or implied
due to various risks and uncertainties. Important factors
that could make a difference to the Company’s operations
include economic and political condition in India and in
the countries in which the Company operates, volatility in
currency rates, changes in government regulations and
policies, tax laws, statutes and other incidental factors. The
Company does not undertake to update these statements.
