Economic Overview and Outlook
Pharmaceutical Sector Overview
Invoice Spending and Growth
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy
is projected by IMF to contract by 3% in 2020, much worse
than during the 2008–09 financial crisis. In a baseline
scenario - which assumes that the pandemic fades in
the second half of 2020 and containment efforts can be
gradually unwound — the global economy is projected
to grow by 5.8% in 2021 as economic activity normalizes,
helped by policy support. The risks for even more severe
outcomes, however, are substantial.
Growth of Emerging Market and Developing Economies is
estimated to contract by 1% in 2020 and bounce back to
6.6% in 2021. India is expected to register 1.9% growth in
2020 and 7.4% in 2021.
Effective policies are essential to forestall the possibility
of worse outcomes. Necessary measures to reduce
contagion and protect lives are important investments
for long-term human and economic health.
The pharmaceutical industry is one of the world’s fastest
growing industries and among the biggest contributors
to the world economy. It plays a unique role in improving
the lives of patients. Its role has become far more critical
amidst the fight against COVID -19 pandemic.
According to the IQVIA Institute paper published in March
2020, global invoice spending has steadily increased from
2014 –2019 with a 5-year CAGR of 4.7% to reach USD 1.2
trillion in 2019. The spending growth is consistent with
the increased global use of medicine and is expected to
register 3-6% CAGR to USD 1.6 trillion by 2024. 

Developed Markets
Developed markets grew at a CAGR of 3.8% in the last
5 years to USD 821.6 billion in 2019. This is now expected
to grow to USD 985 billion – 1 trillion by 2024, at a CAGR
of 2-5%.
As per IQVIA, USA’s share in global invoice spending is
projected to increase to USD 605-635 billion in 2024 from
USD 510 billion in 2019. This will be at a CAGR of 3 - 6% as
compared with 4.3% CAGR in the previous 5 years.
Pharmerging Markets
This market grew at 7% CAGR in the last 5 years to USD
357.7 billion. It is now estimated to reach USD 475 – 505
billion in 2024, registering CAGR of 5-8%

Most emerging market growth has been driven by access
expansions, leading to greater volume use and adoption of
more novel therapies. These include specialty medicines,
which are projected to contribute more to spending than
in previous periods. However, most of the products used
in these countries are non-original products, which aids
in keeping spending low despite expanding volume. As
a result, projections suggest most countries will have
slower growth than historical CAGRs.


USD1.2 trillion
Global pharma invoice spending
in 2019, significant contributor to
world economy

As per the IQVIA, in 2019, the Indian Pharmaceutical
Market (IPM) stood at about USD 22 billion, growing at
9.5% CAGR for 2014-19, at the back of volume, price
and new launches. The IPM, earlier considered immune
to economic downturns, seems to be now defying the
trend and has slowed down in tandem with the broader
economy. Analysis of IPM’s growth drivers indicates
slowdown coming from various external forces. Growth
from product introduction has reduced substantially
as the regulator is more careful with new combination
drugs. Frequent regulatory interventions have also added
to the woes.
Rest of the World markets grew by 5-year CAGR of 4.8%
to USD 71 billion in 2019. This is now estimated to reach
USD 85-95 billion by 2024.
Ajanta Pharma is a specialty pharmaceutical formulation
company engaged in the development, manufacture and
marketing of quality finished dosages. The Company has
a well-diversified and de-risked business model with over
70% of business coming from a wide range of branded
generic products in over 30 countries in Asia (including
India) and Africa. The balance 30% is contributed by
generics business in USA and anti-malaria institutional
business in Africa.
Our strategy to invest in different markets and geographies
in a sustained manner has made our business model
quite resilient. We have also built competitive edge in
each of the markets by identifying unmet needs and
offering customized products. It is this edge that provides
us continuous growth.
Following analysis and discussion is based on the
consolidated financials of the company for the financial
year 2020. It covers different business verticals as well as
the consolidated financial position as a whole.

India Business

Ajanta Pharma’s India business continued to perform
well steered by strong focus on high growth specialty
segments. Total sales from India business stood at H 769
cr. against H 690 cr. in the previous year.
As per IMS MAT March 2020, the Company outgrew
Indian Pharmaceutical Market (IPM) recording 13%
growth compared to 11% for the industry, maintaining
its healthy track record for last 5 years, as described in
Exhibit-3. Company has also improved its ranking in IPM
to 30th against 31st last year.

The Company continues to strengthen product portfolio
through new launches, many of them being first-tomarket products, offering significant patient benefits.
Apart from new launches, many of the Company’s existing
products continue to grow their market share.


International business

Total sales from international business for FY 2020 stood
at H 1,790 cr. against H 1,324 cr. in the previous year, a
growth of 35%. It was primarily backed by robust growth
of 82% in the US market and strong growth in branded
generics at 27% in Asia and 14% in Africa.

Our strategy to invest in
different markets and
geographies in a sustained
manner has made our business
model quite resilient

As explained in Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5, company’s exports
revenues are contributed by well-diversified markets,
avoiding over dependence on any single market.

Operational and Financial Performance

It was a year of rebound after small de-growth in the
previous year. Our strategy to remain focused on our
core markets for growth and investing in the US market
has helped us reclaim our growth

Profit and Loss Statement

Revenue from operations
Revenue from operations stood at H 2,588 cr. in FY 2020
against H 2,055 cr. in FY 2019, registering growth of
26%. The US generic business saw a major pull after 7

products were launched in FY 2020, and annualised sales
for products launched during H2 FY 2019 were received.
Material costs
Material cost has seen a major shift during the year,
moving from 19% in FY 2019 to 25% in FY 2020, a jump
of 600 basis points. This was mainly on account of US
business increasing its share in the total revenue and
increase in some of the raw material prices. We expect
the cost to remain on the same lines in the future.
Employee expenses
Personnel expenses came down by about 200 basis points
to 19% this year from 21% last year on the back of faster
growth of revenue from operations. Total cost stood at
H 486 cr. for FY 2020 as against H 431 cr. in FY 2019. The
increase in absolute amount was on account of addition of
teams at new plant locations of Pithampur and Guwahati,
apart from annual increments provided for the year.
Other expenses
Other expenses stood at H 763 cr. in FY 2020 (29% of
revenue from operations) as against H 675 cr. in FY 2019
(33% of revenue from operations), a 400 basis point
improvement over previous year. We were able to further
improve efficiency in operations with manufacturing,
marketing, distribution, R&D and administrative expenses
being monitored closely in the face of challenges. R&D
cost dropped to 6% of revenue from operations in FY
2020. In absolute amount, it stood at H 164 cr. in FY 2020
against H 176 cr. in FY 2019. Effective steps are being
taken to economise on all costs, without impacting the
business objectives.
Exceptional item
Pursuant to a fire incident on 31 August 2019 at Guwahati
plant, certain property, plant and equipment and inventory
were damaged. The Company lodged insurance claim for
the damages and the net loss of H 3.92 cr. after adjusting
insurance claim receivable has been presented under
exceptional item.
Operating Profit Margin
EBITDA in FY 2020 stood at H 683 cr., a 22% growth over
previous year and 26% of revenue from operations,
as against H 558 cr. in FY 2019, being 27% of operating
revenue. Going forward, as the manufacturing capacity
utilisation improves for the newly set up facilities, we
expect these margins to further improve over a period
of time.
Net Profit Margin
Profit After Tax was at H 468 cr. against H 387 cr., a growth
of 21% over previous year. Net margins stood at 18% in FY

Non-current assets
We have added another H 230 cr. in property plant
and equipment (including CWIP), in line with our plans
to build world-class infrastructure for meeting the
future growth requirement. This includes a green field
manufacturing facility at Pithampur in Madhya Pradesh
and commencement of oral solid section at Guwahati
apart from maintenance capex at existing facilities. The
non-current assets have gone up to H 1,677 cr. in FY 2020
against H 1,516 cr. in FY 2019.
Current assets
Current Assets came up to H 1,642 cr. in FY 2020 from
H 1,180 cr. in FY 2019 mainly because of increase in trade
receivables. Trade Receivable saw a major jump against
last year in terms of number of days to sales, where
it increased to 111 days in FY 2020 from 83 days in FY
2019 on the back of growing US operations. The absolute
amount stood at H 775 cr. in FY 2020 against H 459 cr. in
FY 2019.
Inventories in terms of number of days to sales, has
improved to 71 days in FY 2020 from 79 days in FY
2019. In absolute amount, it has increased to H 496 cr. in
FY 2020 against H 436 cr. in FY 2019.

shareholders’ fund to its shareholders through dividend.
Non-current liabilities
Increase in deferred tax and lease liabilities for H 34 cr.
have taken non-current liabilities to H 114 cr. in FY 2020
from H 73 cr. in FY 2019.
Current liabilities
Trade payables for increased US business resulted in
higher current liability at H 606 cr. in FY 2020 against
H 378 cr. in FY 2019.
Balance Sheet
The year ahead seems challenging due to the prevalent
COVID 19 situation and require a tremendous response
on costs. Efficient operations, cost optimization and
delivery automation will be the key focus areas going into
the next year. We also anticipate our working capital to
increase, but our strong balance sheet combined with a
focus on cash conservation provides us the confidence
that we will emerge stronger and better. 

Consolidated Cash Flow

Company had a healthy cash flow during FY 2020, the
snapshot of this is in Exhibit 7.
With our major capex cycle coming to conclusion with all
major greenfield projects getting completed, we expect
the free cash flows to improve in coming years.

Risk Management
While we are writing this report, we are in the midst of
COVID-19 pandemic. There is high level of uncertainty
about the duration of the lockdown and the time required
for things to get normal. The extent to which COVID-19
pandemic will impact the operations and financial results
is dependent on the future developments, which are
highly uncertain. This is a major risk in the immediate
future and its long term impact needs to be assessed.
Your Company has been proactive in terms of managing
risks in an organised manner. A review of the risk
management policy is carried out Annually by the Risk
Management Committee and the Board of Directors so as
to ensure that new risks which might arise or the impact of
existing risks which might have increased are identified and
a proper strategy is put in place for mitigating such risks.
During the year, major risks identified and their mitigation
plan are enumerated hereunder:
Regulatory Risk
Pharmaceutical industry is a highly regulated segment
with many local and overseas agencies monitoring it. The
regulatory framework covers entire spectrum of activities
like, development and approval of product, approval of
manufacturing facilities, etc. Hence, the regulatory risk is
one of the significant risks identified by the management.
Company has implemented detailed Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP) for every important activity, has a strong
quality assurance function (QA), robust IT framework
for compliance, monitoring and documentation, etc. for
mitigating the regulatory risks.
Competition & Price Control Risk
Being a global pharmaceutical player, selling branded
generic and generic formulations across the globe,
competition and price pressures are common risk in all
markets. Company has a strong mitigation mechanism
for this risk with the strategy to launch differentiated highvalue products meant for specialty segments and first-tofile products having latest off-patent molecules. Further, we
keep improving operational efficiencies to rationalize costs.
Forex Risk
About 70% of the company’s turnover comes from exports
and hence, foreign currency risk is one of the important
risks it has to manage on continuous basis, some of
them being adverse sharp movement in local/overseas
currency rates. Company has a Forex policy and forex
risk management committee in place to manage forex
exposure. It manages forex risk with hedging about 50% of
its foreign currency exposures with plain vanilla forwards.
Financial Risk
Tax uncertainty and debtor default could have adverse
financial impact. Credit risk is the risk that a counter

party does not meet its obligations under a financial
instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial
loss. The mitigation plan includes dealing mainly with
stockists, distributors and customers who have been
transacting with the group for long periods and credit
limits established for all customers based on rating
criteria.
Data Security Risk
Data security breach can result in increased internal and
external security threats, leading to business disruption,
reputational damages and litigations. An elaborate
mitigation plan is in place including access restrictions,
firewalls, backups and documented antivirus policy.
Economic & Political Environment Risk
Company’s operations span across the globe having
diverse political and economic environments. Any
adverse change like political instability leading to policy
uncertainty, tariff/ trade wars, economic sanctions,
leading to weakening of Global economy may impact
company’s business. Company continuously evaluates
political and economic scenario across the globe and
restricts overall exposure to identified countries, in terms
of sales and invested capital. 

Internal Controls and Adequacy

Your Company has implemented an Internal Financial
Control (IFC) framework to ensure proper internal controls
over financial reporting. Internal Controls safeguard
Company’s assets against loss from unauthorised use and
ensures reliability of financial reporting. It is also designed
for effectiveness and efficiency of operations, compliance
or regulations backed by strong audit framework at all
the locations. A well-defined system of internal audit is in
place so as to independently review and strengthen these
internal controls. The Audit Committee of the Company
reviews the reports of the internal auditors quarterly
and recommends steps for further improvement of the
internal controls.

expectations may be forward-looking statements. Actual
results may differ materially from those expressed or
implied due to various risks and uncertainties. Important
factors that could make a difference to the Company’s
operations include economic and political condition in
India and in the countries in which the Company operates,
volatility in currency rates, changes in government
regulations and policies, tax laws, statutes and other
incidental factors. The Company does not undertake to
update these statements.
